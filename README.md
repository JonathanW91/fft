streamed FFT implementation in VHDL
===================================

The contents of this repository document the development of a FFT algorithm for usage on FPGA devices. From the first grasp of theory behind regular DFT, moving on to a full scale FFT implementation and resulting in a streamed architecture suitable for FPGA signal processing applications, all steps taken are documented and made available.
